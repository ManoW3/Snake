# Terminal Snake Game

An *almost* fully functional snake game

I made this for fun to have some more practice with vectors and header files

To Compile: g++ -o s snake.cpp Source/initArray.cpp Source/printScreen.cpp -lncurses

Note: I don't know if this will run on widnows because my current install is broken and I have no way to test :(

Note2: I know there was no need to put those 2 functions in seperate files, however I wanted to learn how to do so
